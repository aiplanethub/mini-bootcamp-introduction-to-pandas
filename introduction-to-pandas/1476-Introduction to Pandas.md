## Learning Objectives

* What is Pandas?
* Why Pandas?
* Why is Pandas so popular?
* How to import Pandas in Python?

## What is Pandas?

* Officially stands for **Python Data Analysis Library**.
* It is an open-source Python library.
* It is a tool used by data scientists to:
  * read,
  * write,
  * manipulate, and
  * analyze the data.

## Why Pandas?

* It helps you explore and manipulate data efficiently.
* It helps you analyze large volumes of data with ease. When we say large volumes, it can be in **millions of rows/records**.

## Why is Pandas so Popular?

* Easy to read and learn
* Extremely fast and powerful
* Integrates well with other visualization libraries

## Importing Pandas

Anytime you want to use a library in Python, the first step is to make it accessible.

You can import/load Pandas in your notebook or any other Python IDE in two different ways:

* **`import pandas`**
* **`import pandas as pd`**

Just as we use the 'np' shorthand for NumPy, we will use the 'pd' shorthand for Pandas. It simply serves as an alias, and it is easier to use 'pd' instead of writing the full form ‘pandas’ while coding.

In this course, we will use **`import pandas as pd`**.
