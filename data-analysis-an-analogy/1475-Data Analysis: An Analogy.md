# Data Analysis - An Analogy

## Let's understand Data Analysis with an example

Imagine you own an apple farm and want to know the number of apples you grow. But, you are too busy with the farm, so you hire someone to count them. You sell your apples too, and you get your apple counter to keep a record of the number of apples you have at the beginning and end of each day.

Many days and months pass, and you put sheet after sheet of the apple count together, and you discover patterns and trends in the purchasing behavior of your customers.

The trends and patterns help you realize that during the colder season, your output of apples is the same, but people buy fewer apples compared to the summer. 

You then set out to dig deeper into this trend and find ways to keep the sales of apples consistent throughout the year, beating your competitors at the game and becoming an apple farm tycoon.

**Apples are your data; tracking them is essential, and analysis is vital.**

For starters, you will know if your supply of apples matches the market's demand and the consistency of the ratio of demand to supply throughout the year. Pegging the price to each apple and drawing the cost down gives you your profit. 

You will find trends and patterns in your production when you have enough data. These trends can help you understand your organization better, help you reduce inefficiency, and therefore reduce costs.

## What is Data Analysis?

You counted your apples on the sheets at the beginning and end of each day in an organized fashion. In the end, you got some insightful information (i.e., trends and patterns in the sales of apples)  from that data. This is called Data Analysis.

So collecting all the words above:\
**Data Analysis is a method of collecting, organizing, and, if required, manipulating the data so one can derive some useful information from the data.**

## Data Analysis and Pandas

Pandas is a tool in Python that helps you collect (or read) data from a file, organize it in a tabular format, and manipulate and clean it, if required, to derive insightful information from it.
