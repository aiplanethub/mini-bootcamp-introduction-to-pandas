# Indexing, Selecting and Assigning

## Real-World Use Case
  \
One of the very first things you should learn is selecting the relevant data quickly and effectively from a DataFrame. This is a very basic step that is needed in almost any data operation that you will run.  
  \
**For example:**  
  
Say, you are a data scientist at Amazon. During the time of New Year, your supervisor asked you to give a discount of 50% for all the electronic items available at Amazon. 


You will never want to go to each electronic item and assign a discount of 50% to each of them. This would be a very time-consuming task. Instead, you would want to select all the items that fall under the category ‘Electronics’ and then give all of them a discount of 50% in one go. So easy, right? This is where you will need indexing, selecting and assigning data in a DataFrame.
