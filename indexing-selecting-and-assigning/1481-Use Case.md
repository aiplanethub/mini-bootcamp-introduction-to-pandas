# Indexing, Selecting, and Assigning

## Real-World Use Case
One of the first things you should learn is to select the relevant data quickly and effectively from a DataFrame. This is a fundamental step needed in almost any data operation you will run.  
**For example:**  
  
Say you are a data scientist at Amazon. During the New Year, your supervisor asked you to give a discount of 50% for all the electronic items available on Amazon. 


You will never want to go to each electronic item and assign a discount of 50% to each of them. This would be a very time-consuming task. Instead, you would want to select all the items that fall under the category ‘Electronics’ and then give all of them a discount of 50% in one go. So easy, right? This is where you will need to index, select, and assign data in a DataFrame.
